            Who we are is a realization of the thoughts we have. However, our minds, the source of our thoughts, are not thought of enough. Our minds fight their own battles, stress, anxiety, depression, and so much more. In fact, over 180 million Indians battle disorders of the mind, corresponding to around 14% of our population.

            However, the battles of the mind are not spoken of, nor is help sought for them. The most we hear are hushed whispers in family events or cathartic cries for help on the latest social media platform that is trending. And where does help for the mind lie?
